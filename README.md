# ClientSideMinesweeper
A simple client-side Minesweeper application in HTML, CSS and clientside Javascript

To build, simply run the command `./build` on Linux or any other POSIX system. This generates a single HTML file named `minesweeper.html`. It will run the game in any HTML5-compatible browser. Currently there is no automated build script for Windows. It is in the list of things to do.

### TODO
 * Implement a `.bat` build file for Windows.
 * Write a decent guide for developers, to help them understand the code
